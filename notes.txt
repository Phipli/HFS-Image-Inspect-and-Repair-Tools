Some files are just a partition
Other files, like MacOS8.1.toast, have a partition table, but no drivers.

Sector = 512 bytes

Process for repair.
1. Trim everything other than the data partition from the start of the bad image :
dd if=./MacOS8.1.toast of=./trimmedMacOS8.1.toast bs=512 skip=37

2. Join the a good partition table / drivers to the start
cat ./driver ./trimmedMacOS8.1.toast > MacOS8.1Fix.iso

The "driver" file needs fixing. a) it has an empty partition. This can be removed,
by zeroing out its entry, and updating the partition count on each entry (from 9 
to 8 in this instance).

The Entry for the data partition needs its length correcting and the data length - its start location
should be just fine.

The partition status may need updating.

Original status 0x0000 0013 means : 
AUX valid, AUX allocated, AUX readable

Driver original status 0x4000 035F means :
Mount at startup, chain driver, real driver,
boot code is position indep (AUX), readable (AUX), valid AUX, entry allocated (AUX),
in use (AUX), contains boot AUX, 
 

First visible data in partition on sector 4138 original image

First try - the drivers were one sector short of a partition, which put the data partition
one sector earlier than it should have been. Fixed in driver now, and implemented in 
driverModified.

Second try mounts, but does not boot - same as when I used toast before.

Third try, I'm replacing the first two bytes (0000) with 4c4b


PowerBook G3 8.1 image is different, no partition table and it is just a raw partition.
Additionally, the first two bytes are good. This likely just needs a partition table,
drivers, appending, and the length inputting.
Alternatively, this can probably be turned into a bootable image using toast and 5.3.1
but that driver version is possibly not compatible with the PB G3?
